# The Hostile Occupation of the World

With the all the events that have been going on as of late, from traditional terrorism, to the murdering of black people by the police meant to protect them, the radicalism spreading not just in Islam but in the body politic of all humanity, and now the attacks in Nice, our collective response has been tantamount to hollow words and empty platitudes. We join rallying cries on social media, watch in shock and horror as things happen, shake our heads, and move on to our next distraction. Yet these things continue to happen in various different ways and to various extents. We say the same words, change our avatars on social media sites, and seem to think we've done our part. We seem to expect these words thrown about on social media to mean something, that our outcry carries weight with so much resonance.

For so long I have seen how the world responds to these things, the deadening of effect by the influence and ease of access to social media. This idea people have that seems to be based around the fact that as long as a post has been shared on Twitter or Facebook, as long as the correct hashtag and meme has been adhered to, that one has done their part. That this is the new voice of moral outrage: impotence masquerading as action. After all, the Internet has changed the face of the world, has brought us all closer together, has it not? You have shared your most visceral feelings, your outrage, disgust, fear. It feels real. It feels like it has meaning.

After all, the pen is mightier than the sword, is it not? Perhaps no one has stopped to realize that a tweet a pen does not make. And while there was a time when the pen was mightier than the sword, that time has passed. The age of the touchscreen, of phantom friends ensconced in inorganic constructs, of pseudo proximity and faux meaning, has allowed us to think that our opinions in this medium carry the same weight.

We do not live in that world anymore. Simply saying a thing is not enough. Believing in things is not enough. Relying on one's speech to be the rallying cry for others to act is not enough. Agreement or disagreement is not enough. The medium we interact through deadens the sentiment and its ability to make change while our linguistic brains and societal training keep telling us that it is the same. Yet it is not.

This is what is blinding us, this is what is allowing the privileged western world to sit back and decry things, feeling as if they are part of the solution, while making not a single change. People are running away from violence because of the violence being visited upon them, their loved ones, and the world they want to be a part of. This is an understandable response.

However, we collectively still cling to this idea that violence being visited upon us will make us stronger so long as we are together. Our civility and refusal to respond in kind makes us better, stronger, unified. We are all of the same mind, saying the same things. We may disagree on the finer points of one belief or system vs. another, but surely the fact that we call are in agreement means something. We are magnanimous. We are concerned. We are willing to act. We say so. We express these feelings in the most available method we have: a device. Perhaps a conversation shared amongst family, friends, or co-workers. The words are spoken. They must be true.

This is a lie.

The realization must dawn: Our entire planet is occupied by an invading, hateful, motivated, and radicalized force. This is not an army. It is not a regime. It is groups of people and sole actors who are radically opposed to one ideal or another, or use that as an excuse to satiate their base animalistic urges to break the taboo of taking human life. It is a force that has no central goal, has no central ideology, support system, or belief. Their goal is the defeat of you and all you stand for. Their goal is their own dominance, their own will being forced upon the world. They have taken the actions they deem necessary to meet that goal. What actions have you taken?

How does one defeat an invader? An occupying force? By pacifism? It is likely many people would look at the independence of India and Ghandi's famous methods throughout that time and use it in reference to now. After all, we are civilized. Not violent. The bad people are the violent ones, we can't be bad people! It worked then, surely it will work now, for the wisest of us have done this before, have they not? No. They have not. This is not that. This is a deceptively and fundamentally different thing. There is no greater power to appeal to. This is not the outcry of the world against the British Empire or the eventual standing up to the Nazis, or any stories if dictators being toppled. There is no international opinion to be brought against an entity to make it changes its ways. This is not something solved by simply saying words, this is not something solved by opinions and feelings, let alone the outpouring of them. This is not solved by simply ignoring or speaking out. This is not solved by anything we are doing as a collective whole.

> It is better to be violent, if there is violence in our hearts, than to put on the cloak of non-violence to cover impotence. Violence is any day preferable to impotence. There is hope for a violent man to become non-violent. There is no such hope for the impotent.  
> - _Mahatma Ghandi, Non-violence in Peace and War, 1942_

People want to kill you. They want you to be afraid. They hate what you stand for, or what skin color you are. They think you are less than. And they are not a unified force. This is not ISIS, the KKK, this is a conspiracy of the likeminded who act on a world stage and we continue to treat them as if they are a single thing we can point to and rail against and sway to change for the better. Our world has become more and more radicalized, with ease of access to inflammatory ideologies, combined with a lessening of critical and independent thinking. All these issues have been present through all of history, but the environment on this planet, in our cities, cultures, and schools of thought, has perhaps never been more ripe to be taken advantage of and used against the masses.

The world you are living in is an occupied zone. More often than not, you will be unable to distinguish between friend or foe until it is far too late and they have taken an action that you cannot correct, that your government cannot stop. This cannot be solved by \#PrayForNice, custom avatars emblazoned with flags, candle-light vigils, or the like. This is not the time for talk.

Whether you believe in pacifism, or the power of change through momentous shifts in society, or outright violence and force of will to meet an enemy head-on and prevail, they can all have their moments, they can all work. History has proven that.

Though you must, we must all, be aware of the differences between then and now. Action and the will to act are everything. Everything else is meaningless when change is necessary. Those who came before us had the will, the courage of their convictions, to act. They stood up. They assembled. They joined. They fought. They organized. They did something. And they did not do it by simply sending postcards from thousands of miles away. They did not do it by sharing with the press of a button their saccharine enjoinders and platitudes.

They did something. In the real world. Something that had meaning, that carried weight. That had within it the seeds of actual change.

We are not doing anything. Other than the Black Lives Matter protests and a few other efforts, most of the world (and that includes all of us who live in that world) feel content to sit back and fire off a slightly emotional or frustrated or poorly constructed tweets, status updates, reposts, hashtags, expletives, meaningless, trite, powerless, ineffectual blathering that does nothing and changes nothing. And it all feels like a contribution. It all feels like a furthering of the cause, of doing right.

This is not how change happens. Action is what changes things. Doing something changes things. Talk or tweet, unless it leads to action, it is meaningless. Your enemies relish this tendency of ours. We have taken ourselves out of the game, removed ourselves as a point of consideration simply because we have contented ourselves to feel as if we have made a difference while we have done nothing to make a difference. We rage against the horrors we see through a meaningless medium and do not hold ourselves to follow up with a true action that bears fruit in the really real world. All while they continue their fight with explosives, bullets, trucks driving with enough kinetic energy to kill dozens, and more. We respond with more words, more sentiments. They kill again.

You have to act, you have to be a part of the change, you have to do more than just sit on the sidelines and watch the world become what you claim to not want it to be. For this is the sidelines, this is what it looks like. All the outrage represented through posts on your timelines is the very definition of the sidelines of the conflict the world finds itself in. You aren't alone, most of the world is on that sideline right along with you.

> The hottest place in hell is reserved for those who in times of moral crisis preserve their neutrality.  
> - _derivation from Dante's Inferno_

This is what neutrality looks like in our day and age. Before the advent of the bit and bandwidth, the value of words carried more weight. But not now. Now they are everywhere, lowered in value by sheer count and propagation, none of which favors value, merely quantity and perceived pithiness to impress one's pseudo friends haunting ghost apps which masquerade themselves as real.

Decisions are made by those who show up. Change is made by those who take action. That action can be passive resistance, engaging with your community to leave no place for these enemies to hide, or other more direct action. It can be going to rallies, engaging with your elected officials, volunteering, reaching out. Doing something that bears actual fruit in the world outside of your devices.

But act you must. For if you act, you can help influence and make the changes that need to happen. If you don't act, or simply talk about what should be done while doing nothing, change will still happen. But it will be a change brought on by those who will take the most consistent action, and right now the only ones doing that are the occupiers. Choose to be a part of change and guide it. Don't think that anyone else is going to step up and do it for you, because everyone else thinks the same thing. Again, your enemies, these occupiers, depend on this complacency from us, depend on the ivory tower of the western world to allow them free reign until it is too late and the barbarians have long since passed the gates.

All revolutions have begun with talk, conversation, dissent, radical ideas, emotions of fear and anger. The same is true in contrast: radicalization of Islam started the same way, ISIS, racial superiority groups, even those thug police who feel afraid of skin color...it all started with thoughts leading to speech leading to action. Your enemies are far ahead of you in this regard. It is time for all your talk to mean something, it is time to make real the will of your words.

What has always been true is still true: All it takes for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing. The trick that has been played on us all is that we have been given a mechanism by which to do things that in actuality does nothing.

Get off your phone and do something.With the all the events that have been going on as of late, from traditional terrorism, to the murdering of black people by the police meant to protect them, the radicalism spreading not just in Islam but in the body politic of all humanity, and now the attacks in Nice, our collective response has been tantamount to hollow words and empty platitudes.
